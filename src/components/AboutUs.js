                      IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
                      is considered to be the largest technical professional
                      organisation dedicated to advancing technology. IEEE has
                      been taking part, since its foundation, in the development
                      of new technologies and improving the performance of
                      existing ones. The influence of this organisation is not
                      limited to a single discipline as it includes diverse
                      scientific fields, of which we can mention the field of
                      our interest: <strong>power electronics</strong>.

                      Our chapter was founded in <strong>April 2022</strong> by
                      a group of students who believe in the great potential of
                      power electronics in making a significant change in the
                      energy field.
